optihood
========

optihood provides a complete python-based framework to OPTImize the investment in alternative energy
technologies (heat pump, solar thermal, PV, etc.) as well as the operation of available energy resources (natural gas,
sun, grid electricity, etc.) at a neighbourHOOD-scale. It is designed to facilitate the researchers and energy planners
in optimizing an energy neighbourhood in terms of cost and/or environmental criteria. It enables the users to perform
both single-objective and multi-objective optimization and analysis. The energy model and it's associated parameters
can be defined easily using an excel file. Additionally, a variety of plotting methods are defined for easy and fast
result visualization.

The package was developed at the `SPF - Institute for Solar Technology <https://www.spf.ch/>`_ at the `OST - Eastern
Switzerland University of Applied Sciences <https://www.ost.ch/>`_.
